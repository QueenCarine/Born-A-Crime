    <p>This book's name was initially <b>"Born A Crime"</b>, however I feel the urge that the title <b>"The Odd Man Out"</b> better speaks what the book instills;
    Trevor's story talks about him being a victim of the apartheid in South Africa since he is colored and therefore didn't fit in any society, he belongs not in the black 
  community and neither does he in the white one. Sometimes he's treated white other times black, he is left out, perhaps he is the odd man out. </p>

    <h2> "He wanted a traditional wife so that he could cage her. "Trevor Noah</h2>
        <p>One of the most haunting yet powerful lines in Born a Crime is when Trevor Noah writes that Abel
           “wanted a traditional wife so that he could cage her.”This quote strikes deeply because it reveals
            how tradition, when twisted, can become a tool for control and manipulation rather than culture. 
            Abel approached marriage in search of dominance in the name of love. He believes that a traditional
             woman is a wife who is willing to obey and submit without questioning the being said or providing 
             any opinions, stay silent, and sacrifice herself to uphold his authority. But Trevor’s mother,
              Patricia, was far away from that woman. She was an independent thinker and outspoken. 
              She believed in living her life with faith and freedom, not fear. What worries me is 
              that men know they want a subservient woman, but cannot settle for that woman; they want 
              a self-made woman so that they can make her small to feed their ego and pride with control 
              over the woman. This quote exposes a mindset that still exists in many societies: the idea 
              that women should be submissive, that their strength must be tamed, that women cannot speak 
              for themselves, and that culture justifies enslavement. Abel wasn’t seeking tradition for the sake
               of values; he was seeking power through control. What I love about Patricia is that she didn’t let 
               herself be caged and mimic her identity to the one that society expects her to be. Even when facing 
               violence, she fought back, not just for herself but for her son too. Her bravery reveals to us that 
               <b>"tradition should never be used as a weapon to fight us, and love should never feel like a prison. 
               Love is meant to be felt, and culture is meant to be celebrated and never to destroy and darken our lives.</b>
                If it doesn't feel right, then it isn't. Reading this part of the book reminded me that we must question 
                the norms before following the herd. Are they truly about respect and harmony, or are they designed to limit 
                our thoughts? Trevor’s story makes us reflect, not only on the past, but on the kind of future we want to
                 build—one where strength in women is celebrated, not silenced. Born a Crime is not just Trevor’s story;
                  it’s a reminder of the lives many pass through every day.
